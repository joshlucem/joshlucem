I write code to understand how systems evolve.

I’m interested in how rules interact, how state changes over time,  
and how simple structures end up taking paths you didn’t anticipate.

#### What I work on

Most of my work involves **game servers** and **backend systems**.  
A lot of it is Minecraft-related:

- NPC behaviour  
- economies  
- progression systems  
- long-running mechanics  

---

I care less about features and more about outcomes.  
If something grows in an unexpected direction, that’s usually the point.

Some projects may look unfinished or overly constrained.  
They’re often left that way on purpose.
