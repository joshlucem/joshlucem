## Hi everyone ;3

I’m Josh Lucem. I’m 20 years old and I really like watermelon.  
I actually study Law and Political Science, which makes most of what I do here feel a bit paradoxical.

I enjoy learning about many different things.  
What I do here is a hobby, but a genuinely rewarding and fun one.  
I might not be as polished as other developers, but I try to do everything with care and genuine interest 🤟

I write code to understand how systems evolve.
